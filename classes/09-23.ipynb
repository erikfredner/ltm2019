    "# Shells and Paths\n",
    "If you have ever seen a movie featuring a hacker character, you have seen a terminal. Think of the green code flying across the screen in *The Matrix*. A terminal provides a command-line interface for operating a computer. Modern interfaces are usually \"graphical,\" meaning that they have buttons, menus, etc. that allow users to issue commands. For example, every app on your phone has a graphical interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, command-line interfaces require us to type commands directly. They are generally more powerful and flexible than graphical interfaces, but more challenging to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Opening your Terminal\n",
    "When you wrote `print('hello')` above, that command was handled by the Python interpreter. In order to run a terminal command, we need to open a terminal emulator.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Jupyter Lab window, click `File > New Launcher`, then select `Terminal` at the bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "A new tab will open with a Terminal window running your system's terminal. Type the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "echo $SHELL\n",
    "```\n",
    "The result should be something like `/usr/bin/bash`. If it is different (e.g. `/usr/bin/zsh`) don't worry--the commands we're learning are the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we're ready to use the terminal to navigate your files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why start here?\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin with the terminal in order to learn how computers store files, which we will need to know in order to access them while we are programming. In the Finder application on the Mac, you merely need to click on a file or folder to see its contents. When I double-click on the file `my_file` in my Home folder, that is a visual metaphor for typing the following command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "open /Users/e/my_file.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "We won't be able to tell Python where our files are or what to do with them without understanding this syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's read that line piece-by-piece. The word `open` points to a program on my Mac that opens files and folders. The initial `/` represents the root of my hard-drive. Each piece of text after a slash names a folder or file. The folder `Users` contains all user accounts on my Mac. `e` is the name of the Home folder for my personal account, which is one of the `Users`. `my_file.txt` refers to the file I double-clicked on.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the above example makes clear, working at the command-line requires us to be explicit and precise. If `my_other_file` is stored in my `Desktop` folder, I cannot open it by typing:\n",
    "```\n",
    "open /Users/e/my_other_file.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "That's because this command tells the computer to find and open `my_other_file.txt` only within `/Users/e/`. Since there is no such file, we get an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The correct command to open a file on my Desktop would be:\n",
    "```\n",
    "open /Users/e/Desktop/my_other_file.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practice\n",

    "`cd` stands for 'change directory.' It allows you to move from one folder to another. You can tell `cd` to take you to folders using *absolute* or *relative* paths.
