    "If you have not studied early Bibles, you likely have not encountered either Wycliffe or Tyndale before. However, `1611_kjb` is one of the most famous works in the English language, the King James Bible. The King James version is perhaps best known for this formulation from Genesis: \"And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.\" It is arguably as influential on style in English poetry and prose as any text, including Shakespeare. It is almost certainly the most widely read literary text in the history of the English language."
