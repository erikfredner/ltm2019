    "# 1. Estimating clauses per sentence\n",
    "Grammatically, clauses refer to any part of a sentence that contains a verb. An example sentence with one clause would be: \"Don Quixote fought the windmill.\" A sentence with two clauses might be: \"Don Quixote fought the windmill, and then he rode away,\" with \"fought\" anchoring the first clause, and \"rode\" the second. Frequently in English, clauses are separated by commas or semi-colons, as in the second example. Sentences with multiple clauses are generally regarded as more complex than single-clause sentences.\n",
